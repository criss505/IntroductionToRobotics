# IntroductionToRobotics
A small corner of my achievements while learning the basics of robotics.üëç<br>
Here I included the work, assignments and most of what I did during my 'Introduction to Robotics' course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science (University of Bucharest) in 2023-2024.

<h2>Homework #2</h2>
For this assignment I had to control an RGB LED using potentiometers. For each color channel there is a separate potentiometer that reads the analog values which are then mapped to the pin.<br><br>

<h2>Homework #3</h2>
This time, the task was to simulate a 3-floor elevator system, each level being represented by a LED. As an extra feature, there was a separate LED and a buzzer that signaled when the "elevator" was moving.<br><br>

<h2>Homework #4</h2>
Using a joystick, I controlled the position of the segment and "drew" on a 7 segment display. I also added features like blinking, reset segments and a buzzer.<br><br>
